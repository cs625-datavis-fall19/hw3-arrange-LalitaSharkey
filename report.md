## Initail data observation
Before start jumping into creating visualizations, I have done some observation in order to gain a better understanding of the datasets. There were 2 datasets given. The first dataset is a daily breakdown information of Norfolk churchs that provide shelters for adults during winter(11/29/2017 to 1/16/2018). The other dataset contains information on daily weather information in the same duration as the first dataset. There were 49 samples in both the datasets.

### Question 2: In total, how many guests were provided shelter by each church (or pair of churches)?
