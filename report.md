## Initail data observation
Before start jumping into creating visualizations, I have done some observation in order to gain a better understanding of the datasets. There were 2 datasets given. The first dataset is a daily breakdown information of Norfolk churchs that provide shelters for adults during winter(11/29/2017 to 1/16/2018). The other dataset contains information on daily weather information in the same duration as the first dataset. There were 49 samples in both the datasets.
## Question 1: What was the breakdown of women vs. men who were provided shelter each night?  
### Part 1 - Using Application (Tableau)  
![Q1](img/Q1.png)
A few experimental designs were created to find the most effective design. The first one that was created was the dual axises bar chart. It was the first thing that came to my mind when I thought about comparing 2 numeric values. The horizontal axis represented dates and the vertical axis representing the number of both

```
MyData <- read.csv(file="merged.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")

require(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)


names(MyData)[names(MyData) == "Ã¯..Date"] <- "Dates"
MyData$Dates <-  as.Date(MyData$Dates, "%m/%e/%Y")

g <- ggplot(MyData, aes(x=Dates, group= 1)) 
g <- g + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,110), breaks=seq(0,110,10), minor_breaks=seq(0,110,10))
g <- g + geom_line(aes(y=Men), colour="#4D79A8", size=2) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=Men), colour="#4D79A8", size=4) +
  geom_text(aes(y = Men[49]+7, x = Dates[49], label = "Men"), colour="#4D79A8", size = 6) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="#4D79A8", 
              aes(x = Dates, y = Men,group=1), size= 0.8, linetype = "dashed")
g <- g + geom_line(aes(y=Women), colour="#FA9FA6", size=2) + 
  geom_point(aes(y=Women),colour="#FA9FA6", size=4) +
  geom_text(aes(y = Women[49]-7, x = Dates[49], label = "Women"), colour="#FA9FA6", size = 6)  + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="#FA9FA6", 
              aes(x = Dates, y = Women,group=1), size= 0.8, linetype = "dashed")
g <- g + theme_minimal()+theme_bw()
g <- g + scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b %d, %y", date_breaks = "1 day", date_minor_breaks = "1 day")
g <- g + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90 , hjust = 1)) 
g <- g + labs(title = "The breakdown of women vs. men who were provided shelter each night", 
              x = "Date", y = "Value") 
g <- g + theme(plot.title = element_text(color = "black", size = 22, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5))
